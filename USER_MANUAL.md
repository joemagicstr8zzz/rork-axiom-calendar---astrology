Axiom Calendar — Start Here + Help/Guide

Start Here (2 minutes)
1) Choose your persona
- Mystic, psych coach, or playful skeptic. Let this guide word choice and pacing.

2) Choose your premise
- Astrology, fate, or Focus-of-the-Month. Pick one lens and stay consistent.

3) Set your reveal
- Create one Quote of the Day tied to a single reveal date. Pre-show seed: “I set an intention in my calendar a while back.”

4) Pick your tech path
- Manual quote in Notes
- Inject endpoint that returns { "value": "courage" }
- GPT on (optional) to polish Inject into a crisp, attributed line

5) Rehearse the beats
- Hook → Conditions → Build → Moment of Magic → Afterglow. Pause 2–3 seconds at reveal.

Core Performance Principles
- Start with effect, not method: “They freely name a date; it matches a quote I set days ago.”
- Build a premise: keep one lens for the whole routine.
- Script structure: Hook → Conditions → Build → Moment of Magic → Afterglow.
- Manage attention: give minds a job before secret actions (“Focus on the month’s word…”).
- Time misdirection: do the dirty work well before the revelation.
- Script ambiguity: “You could have changed your mind again.”
- Persona voice: vocabulary and pacing should match your chosen persona.
- Spectator roles: one leader, one validator. Give status and clear tasks.
- Pacing and silence: don’t talk over the gasp.
- Multiple outs: prepare 2–3 framings so near-misses still land.
- Souvenir and callback: screenshot + “Check your quote on the 21st.”

Language & Scripting Tools
- Anchors: “Long before today…,” “You committed in your mind…,” “You could have changed it.”
- Conditional: “If this aligns, you’ll feel it immediately.”
- Dual reality softeners: to the leader only—“You locked that in privately.”
- Emotional labels: Clarity, Courage, Release.

Audience Management
- Consent and comfort: offer non-personal alternatives to birthdays/private dates.
- Clear choices: offer three clean options that all serve your method.
- Reset discipline: keep the app exactly where it needs to open.

Calendar/Astrology-Specific Tips
- Premise: “Time leaves fingerprints.” Use dates, moon cycles, or Focus-of-the-Month to justify.
- Pre-show framing: “I set an intention in the calendar a while back.”
- Revelation hierarchy: chosen date → Focus word → exact pre-set quote.
- Treat the app as a journal of commitments, not a trick device.
- Aftercare: invite them to revisit that date.

Common Outs
- Near-miss: “Sometimes fate whispers, not shouts—notice the theme matches your choice.”
- Full miss: pivot to reading—“Then the calendar is talking about what you need next, not now.”
- Data-stall: “Keep the date in mind; I don’t want the phone to steal our moment.” Do a non-tech beat, then return.

Rehearsal Checklist
- Script beats and underline the exact sentence before the reveal.
- Block your hands: where is the phone; when do you unlock; which thumb taps.
- Record rehearsal; cut filler before the moment of magic.
- Test on a non-magician; watch their eyes, not your method.

Two-Minute Routine (Calendar Reveal)
- Hook: “Each month has a Focus. This one: Courage. Let’s see if time already knew something about you.”
- Choice: “Name any date this month—change your mind if you like.” Confirm aloud.
- Conditions: “This lives in my calendar. I can’t edit what’s already written.” Phone face-down.
- Build: “Lock that date in your mind. Think of what courage would mean on that day.”
- Secret beat: navigate to the pre-set Quote-of-the-Day while speaking slowly.
- Moment: turn phone face-up to the selected date. “Long before today, I set one line for that exact day…”
- Reveal: read the quote. Pause. Let them react.
- Afterglow: “When that day arrives, notice if life gives you a chance to choose this.” Offer a screenshot as a keepsake.

Full Script: Focus-of-the-Month
- Premise: month’s Focus guides choices. Persona: psych coach.
- Hook: “This month’s Focus is Alignment. Keep that in mind.”
- Leader names any date; validator confirms.
- Conditions: “I set one commitment line weeks ago—couldn’t change it now.” Phone face-down.
- Build: “Picture what Alignment would ask of you on that day.” Quietly open that day’s saved quote.
- Moment: display day view. “Long before today…” Read the line. Breathe.
- Afterglow: screenshot to leader. Callback: “On the 21st, notice if this surfaces.”

Full Script: Astrology Lens
- Premise: “Time leaves fingerprints.” Persona: mystic.
- Hook: “We’re in Aries—momentum. Name any date that pulls you.”
- Conditions: “I wrote one line for that night long ago.”
- Build: “Feel the moon’s pull around that date.” Navigate quietly.
- Moment: reveal Focus word first, then the exact quote.
- Outs: if near-miss, lean into theme resonance; if miss, reframe as “what you need next.”

Full Script: Playful Skeptic
- Premise: psychology of commitment.
- Hook: “Decisions made ahead of time beat moods. Pick any date.”
- Conditions: “I can’t type fast enough to rig this now.” Phone idle, face-down.
- Build: “If this aligns, you’ll feel it immediately.” Cue the saved quote.
- Moment: “You could have landed anywhere.” Turn phone; read the line. Pause.
- Afterglow: “If this speaks to you, it’s because you were already moving toward it.”

Tech Setup (Brief)
- Quote of the Day: one reveal date at a time; new replaces old.
- Inject: endpoint returns JSON with a single value field. Example: { "value": "courage" }. Validate in Settings.
- GPT (optional): add API key/model; polishes Inject into a crisp quote. Falls back gracefully if offline.
- Month behavior: if a reveal day is set, the quote appears on the Month screen when that date is selected.

Sample Lines You Can Lift
- “You could have landed anywhere—today, yesterday, or a date that only matters to you.”
- “Decisions made ahead of time are stronger than moods. That’s why I set this weeks ago.”
- “If this speaks to you, it’s because you were already moving toward it.”
